# Okay, here are three benefits of mangoes:

# 1.  **Rich in Vitamins and Antioxidants:** Mangoes are an excellent source of Vitamin C, which is crucial for immune function, collagen production, and skin health. They also contain other vitamins like Vitamin A (important for vision) and antioxidants like quercetin and beta-carotene, which help protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals.
# 2.  **May Improve Digestion:** Mangoes contain amylase enzymes that help break down complex carbohydrates, making them easier to digest. They also provide dietary fiber, which aids in promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.
# 3.  **Good for Eye Health:** The Vitamin A and antioxidants like zeaxanthin and lutein found in mangoes contribute to good vision and can help protect the eyes from age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.
